# Diary/log of Events
The diary is here to represent changes and references regarding softer skills such as research and code snippets
and to provide a view for tracking learning those softer skills github issue will likely be used to track active coding issues


## TODO
- Make general proposal 
- research flask 
- focus on core of the project the dropdown menu and the ai learning stuff 
- maybe do some research on how to fine tune models 
- look up a pre-trained model on hugging face for reference 
- some coding example test to illustrate the proof opf concept
- finish of react front end and take some placeholder 
- add the ai java programmes maybe some more research into how i might use them and api keys 
- test and troubleshoot user login 


## COMPLETED
- Better understanding of the make up of AIs and the fact you can uses schemas and builders to guide LLMs to  structure your data accordingly using few-shot prompting or embedding model-based classification 
- Added The backend and set up and started the process of setting up python in the ven works perfectly so starting that application does work 
- Research and implement flask server with cors hooks
- Added frontend
- Added some test data for the flask server
- End to end working checked using console messages
- added login
- added lexicon loader achieved a better understanding of how they work also
